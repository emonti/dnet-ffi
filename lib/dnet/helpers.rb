    # the :raw tag.

    # Returns a new instance of self.class containing a seperately allocated 
    # copy of all our data. This abstract method can be called from overridden 
    # 'copy()' implementations. 
    #
    # Note that this determine's size automatically based on the structure size.
    # This may not be what you want if your structure contains variable-length
    # data. Screw it up, and don't be supprised if you get weird/missing data 
    # or worse -- segfaults and bus error crashes from ruby.
    #
    # Implementing a correct 'copy' is required for structures passed to
    # the looping callbacks. These callbacks are found throughout the dnet(3) 
    # API. The instances passed into the callback are free'd as soon as the 
    # yield is finished.
    #
    # For example:
    #
    #    ary =[]
    #    # => []
    #    Dnet::Arp::Handle.each_entry do |en| 
    #           ary << en.copy
    #           ary << en
    #    end
    #    # => 0
    #    ary.each {|x| p [x.pa.addr, x.ha.addr] }
    #    #["192.168.116.4", "de:ad:be:ef:ba:be"]  # the copy
    #    #[nil, nil]                              # original
    #    # => [#<Dnet::Arp::Entry:0x5017e8>, #<Dnet::Arp::Entry:0x501978>]
    #  
    # Only the entry that was copied is now usable outside the each_entry 
    # block. This is because the entry passed into the block ('en') was freed 
    # by eth_loop after FFI called back to the block.
    # 
    # Copying can get hairy when your structure contains fields that are 
    # pointers. But that's what overriding is for. Just allocate and copy
    # over to new pointers, then assign the structure members.
    # 
    # This method also includes a 'grown' parameter which is added to the
    # size of the struct when allocating and copying over the new data.
    def copy(grown=0)
      self.class.new( :raw => self.to_ptr.read_string(self.size+grown) )
